# Gym-Management-System
The APU Gym Centre Management System (AGC) is a gym management software that 
targets three types of users, namely manager, trainer and customer. The aim of the system is to 
provide APU Gym Centre with a better implementation of a system that could unleash its full 
potential growth by streamlining a series of business processes. Moreover, the objectives of 
developing the system are to manage the end usersâ€™ records and handle daily operations of the gym 
center more efficiently and productively, as compared to the traditional system that runs manually
and consumes more time.
